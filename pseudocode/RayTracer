keep previous frame
apply transformations based on
	camera movement
	camera rotation
	object movement
	object rotation
	object animation <--- most challenging

	if two pixels from a previous frame overlap in the new frame, we could take just the one in the front, or we could blend between them

add new rays as proportional value over transformed frame
	if new space / previous occluded use 100% of the ray value
	otherwise use annealing value based on how long things have stayed the same?
	or just a fixed moderate new amount, like 10-33%
